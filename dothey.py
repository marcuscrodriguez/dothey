Positive behavior (+1) represents the frequency and consistency of beneficial behaviors exhibited in the relationship. While a value closer to (-1) indicates the frequency and consistency of negative behaviors. Higher positive behavior scores indicate a healthier relationship dynamic, characterized by frequent displays of affection, prioritization of quality time, and mutual support. Conversely, higher negative behavior scores may indicate areas of concern such as lack of communication or conflict resolution. Positive (+1)  and negative (-1) emotion scores reflects the perceived level of emotional support and understanding within the relationship including the comfort level in expressing vulnerabilities and fears with your partner. Higher emotional scores suggest a strong emotional bond and mutual understanding. Lower scores may indicate a need for improved communication and empathy within the relationship. Thoughts/Decisions are also measured positively (+1) and negatively (-1) reflecting the perception of long-term compatibility as well as level of trust  impacting the confidence in the relationship's future and belief in your partner's decision-making ability. Lower scores may suggest uncertainty or lack of trust, which could benefit from open communication and reassurance. A higher positive sentiment analysis score suggests overall satisfaction and contentment within the relationship, while a higher negative sentiment analysis score may indicate dissatisfaction or concern.")
